# Unsupervised-learning-of-Traffic-mortality
The "Reducing Traffic Mortality in USA" project aims to address rising traffic deaths. It analyzes victim demographics and identifies patterns using data wrangling, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. The goal is to create an action plan for states with similar profiles.

## Project flow
### 1. Create a textual and a graphical summary of the data
### 2. Quantify the association of features and accidents
### 3. Fit a multivariate linear regression
### 4. Perform PCA on standardized data
### 5. Visualize the first two principal components
### 6. Find clusters of similar states in the data
### 7. KMeans to visualize clusters in the PCA scatter plot
### 8. Visualize the feature differences between the clusters

### 9. Compute the number of accidents within each cluster
### 10. Decision
